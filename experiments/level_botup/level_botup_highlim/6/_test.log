Level
....level is computed as FO
....use shortest path as dist = 0
....pick min of dist as level = 0
....Level is computed on pAbs = 1
Itp
....Itp is computed with incremental sat solver = 0
....Itp is computed on pAbs = 0
....G support contain merge frontier = 1
....G supprot contain not same merge frontier support = 5
....cost eval of the patch is 0
....coef of cost eval = 0.000000
Shrink
....keep special case 0 in Gsupport first
....shrink base on level of pAbs
FD Rewrite
....synthesis before replacement = 1
....synthesis after rewriting = 0
